Semicolons
In C programming Semicolon is used to show the termination of Instruction. It is also called a statement terminator since every single statement should be ended with a semicolon. Semicolons are used to end statements in C.

The Semicolon tells the compiler that the current statement has been terminated. If any statement in the Program ends without a semicolon, then the program will not compile and will generate an error message.

C

// C program to demonstrate use of Semicolon
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main() { printf("GeeksforGeeks") return 0; }
